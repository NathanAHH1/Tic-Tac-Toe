# Hi There! 👋
## About Me ⚙️

I am Nathan Eigler, a **Software Developer** (Specializing in Front End Web Development), and **Solo Game Developer**, focusing on computer engineering for post secondary education.

Outside of programming I picked up guitar and the drums, playing in school bands and making up songs at home, I am mostly self taught and the only education i've gotten is through concert band.
